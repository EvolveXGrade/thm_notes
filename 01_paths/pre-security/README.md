# Pre Security Path

This folder contains my notes from the **Pre Security** learning path on TryHackMe.

The purpose of this path is to build foundational cybersecurity knowledge before moving into more technical or specialized areas.

Notes here follow the order of the path and focus on understanding core ideas rather than memorizing commands.

---

## Goals of This Path

- Understand basic cybersecurity concepts and terminology
- Build a solid base for future technical paths

---

## How Notes Are Organized

Each file corresponds to a topic or lesson within the Pre Security path.

Notes typically include:
- What the concept or tool is
- What kind of problem it addresses
- What type of information it helps discover
- Minimal examples when relevant

Detailed or reusable ideas extracted from these lessons may later be moved to:
- `02_methodology/`
- `03_tools/`
- `04_checklists/`

## Progress

- [x] Introduction to Cyber Security
- [ ] Network Fundamentals
- [ ] How the Web Works
- [ ] Linux Fundamentals

(This list will be updated as I progress through the path.)
