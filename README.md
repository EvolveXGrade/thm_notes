# TryHackMe Notes

This repository contains my personal notes and learning journey through the TryHackMe platform.

The goal is not to document walkthroughs, but to build a structured knowledge base focused on:
- Understanding core cybersecurity concepts
- Extracting reusable patterns and methodologies
- Connecting tools with the problems they solve

These notes evolve as I progress and revisit concepts.
